# pipeline directory
This directory is meant for scripts that are project specific, for example bash script calling iteratively 
some of the project agnostic runner scripts available im the UPSCb-common submodule, _e.g._ a script looping on
the raw data to pseudo-quantify expression using salmon (and the runSalmon.sh script in UPSCb-common)
